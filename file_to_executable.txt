(make sure pip and pyinstaller are installed/updated)

cd to directory that contains your .py file
pyinstaller...
        -F                  (all in 1 file)
        -w                  (removes terminal window) <-- typically done for GUI prompts or popups
        -i iconName.ico     (adds custom icon to .exe)
        fileName.py         (name of your main python file)

.exe is then located in the dist folder
